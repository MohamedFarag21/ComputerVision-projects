### Computer-Vision
A repository that includes a lot of computer vision projects.

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. [1]

*We can see clearly today that **CV** is every where in our new digitalized world, from face detection to generating art like humans.
the turning point for the field was when CNN(Convolutional Neural Netwroks) was developed but not only that; also when hardware was capable of training enormous models while reducong time needed to do so.

*At this repository i will include a lot of updated resources to learn about computer vision, From courses to books and for sure the hottest and the most effective papers in this field*

*Happy Learning* :blush:

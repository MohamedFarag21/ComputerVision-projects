#**Visualizing CNNs' activations are one of the most important and intuitive techniques to understand what are the outputs from your layers.**
***First of all, thanks to *Francois Chollet* for his great book and explanations, part of the code at this repo was developed by him at his book***

## 1- What are the activations ?
Activations are the output from the CNN layers, also they are called the output feature maps, which mainly generated after using the convolutional operation.

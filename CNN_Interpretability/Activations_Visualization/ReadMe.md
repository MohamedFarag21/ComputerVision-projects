#Visualizing CNNs' activations are one of the most important and intuitive techniques to understand what are the outputs from your layers.
***First of all, thanks to Francois Chollet for his great book and explanations, part of the code at this repo was developed by him at his book***

## 1- What are the activations ?
Activations are the output from the CNN layers, also they are called the output feature maps, which mainly generated after using the convolutional operation.

### SO here we develop the steps easily to get out outputs:
1- First choose your model.
2- load your data.
3- Choose the layers you want to visualize its activations.
4- Generate the activations maps.
5- Visualize (**The part of the code built by Francois ‚ù§**)

In this project, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

1- Understand what autoencoders are and why they are used

2- Design and train an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras.

By the end of this project, you will be able to design and build an autoencoder neural network to create high-resolution images from low resolution source images.
